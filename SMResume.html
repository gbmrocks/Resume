On my freetime, most of my time is spent on figure skating. I have passed the Intermediate Moves in the Field and the Pre-Preliminary Freestyle tests. I have been involed in an Open Juvenile Synchronized Skating team. Over the past two years, we have traveled to Fort Meyers, Florida and Hersey, Pennsylvania for the Synchronized Skating Eastern Sectional championships. In 2017, my team and I came in the top four of our group and were able to make in to final round to compete with the best teams in the East Coast. Also on my freetime, I volunteer my time to the New England Skating Club for small things such as collecting money for icetime and for big things such as car wash fundraisers or social activites for the club. In 2018, I was one of three chosen, for the first time at our club, for U.S. Figure Skating <em> Get Up </em> award for my perserverence and hard work.
