          Extra Curricular Activites

            <body> 
Most of my time is spent on the sport of figure skating. I have passed the Intermediate Moves in the Field and the Pre-Preliminary Freestyle tests. I have been involed in an Open Juvenile Synchronized Skating team, and I am continuing with the team this year. Over the past two years, my team and I have traveled to Fort Meyers, Florida and Hersey, Pennsylvania for the Synchronized Skating Eastern Sectional championships. In 2017, my team and I came in the top four of our competitive group and were able to make it to the final round to compete with the best teams in the East Coast. <br> Also, on my freetime, I volunteer my time to the New England Skating Club. I do small things such as collecting money for icetime every Wednesday, and for big things such as car wash fundraisers or social activites for the club. <br> In February of 2018, I was one of three chosen, for the first time at our club, for U.S. Figure Skating <em> Get Up </em> award for my perserverence and hard work.
